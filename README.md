# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling and Analysis
In this project, we'll be analyzing tweet data, associated with rating dogs based on their photos and videos. The goal is to wrangle data to create interesting and trustworthy analysis and visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset is the tweet archieve of a popular Twitter account WeRateDogs, which rates dogs with humorous comments and has millions of followers. The archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.  

## Key takeaways
(1) Top 10 dog names in the dataset are Charlie, Cooper, Lucy, Oliver, Tucker, Penny, Lola, Winston, Bo, and Sadie.

(2) Of the four dog types used in the rating system - puppers, puppos, doggos, or floofers - doggos tend to receive higher rankings on average compared to other dog stage types.

(3) Rankings do not correlate with favorite counts, i.e. tweets, which feature dogs with higher ratings, don't tend to get higher favorite count.
